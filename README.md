# React

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`React`](https://github.com/facebook/react);

## Install
```bash
> npm install 
```
## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run 
```
## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> If you want to deploy to vercel, pls select react lang
